# Reflection

This README is intended to describe my thoughts and feelings about how I have come so far at the half way point of this coding bootcamp and also to dwell on future plans and goals for the rest of the bootcamp and on into the future.

# The Journey So Far

- What have I learned so far?

When I first started this course I was a bit of a mess when it came to computer literacy. Terminal was crazy confusing. Navigating my files and creating files was confusing. I didn't know anything about HTML or MD, nothing about CSS or JavaScript! Now I know all kinds of useful shortcuts for navigating the computer, I can navigate terminal with ease, I have a file structure that I can navigate easily and know where and how to put things. Now I can understand HTML files and I actually use MD all the time using Amazon Chime at work and also a game I like to play called Habitica!
I can use CSS to decorate my html pages and I have learned infinite things to make applicarions dynamic with JavaScript!

- What have I accomplished?

I have to date made 29 repos! Some have turned out better than others, but I have learned a ton along the way. I have spruced up my LinkedIn and updated my resume. I started attending coding meetups including She's Coding, a local meetup for all women and minorities coding and interview support! I have made some amazing connections and friendships with people all along the way.

- Thinking back on my first week, how have I grown and changed since then?

While I still do have periods of confusion and intense frustration, looking back on the first week I had such a hard time with the basic computer stuff it was difficult for me to follow along, get to the correct folder, file, and then actually start doing the in class activities. I spent weeks feeling like such a dummy dumb dumb. But now I know where to go to find everything, I have learned shortcuts that make my life so much easier, and now I am actually able to help some of my fellow students learn the things I have learned!



# Path To Success

- What are my goals through the remainder of the course?

My goals are to learn how to overcome the hump of not knowing how to start an application. When all I have is a README to go off of, I really struggle to know how to start coding. I often will take another example to reference to help me get started, but I really struggle to know exactly what they other application is doing in contrast with mine, and often times I will add unnecessary code because I do not know exactly what those specific things are doing. I would like to overcome that.

I also would like to get better at the pre-class drills to be able to be better at the interview and white boarding so that  am better prepared when I start searching for a job as software engineer.

- What do I hope to accomplish before the course completes?

I would like to go through all of my homework assignments and make them really stand out. Due to time constraints I didn't always have as much time as I would have liked to make those homeworks not just functional but also pretty. I would like to go back and make them look how I would have wanted them to originally if I had had the time to do so.

- What do I hope to accomplish after the course completes?

I am going to apply to get into the Amazon Technical Academy to take another course in software engineering. After that course completes you are supplied with an internship within Amazon. If I don't get into that, I was going to try to get into Apprenti or Aida (both highly competitive), and if I don't get into any of those, just try to get an intership as a software engineer or try to get a job as a software engineer!

- What do I plan to do to ensure that I accomplish these goals?

Well, I am planning to take 2 months off work so I can focus on the conclusion of this course as well as focus on getting into the ATA. In the meantime I will plan on attending as many coding meet up groups as I can to keep motivated. I would also consider taking a gamble as many people have done, which is to quit their current jobs to focus on getting a job as a software engineer!

- How do these plans and goals differ from the first half of the course?

The first half of the course I was so completely absorbed in not getting lost anymore that I completely forgot that the reason that I did this was to get a job! A few months in as I started to get comfortable I started following along better, I to think about what aspects of the industry that I was most interested in and started getting involved with groups that helped with getting prepared for interviews and such. I am now much more career focused and thinking about my plans after the course than I was at the beginning!
